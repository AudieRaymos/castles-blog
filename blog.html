                    <p>Dover Castle is a medieval castle in Dover, Kent, England. It was founded in the 11th century and
                        has been described as the "Key to England" due to its defensive significance throughout history.
                        Some sources say it is the largest castle in England, a title also claimed by Windsor Castle.
                        This site may have been fortified with earthworks in the Iron Age or earlier, before the Romans
                        invaded in AD 43. This is suggested on the basis of the unusual pattern of the earthworks which
                        does not seem to be a perfect fit for the medieval castle. Excavations have provided evidence of
                        Iron Age occupation within the locality of the castle, but it is not certain whether this is
                        associated with the hillfort. The site also contains one of Dover's two Roman lighthouses (or
                        pharoses), one of only three surviving Roman-era lighthouses in the world, and the tallest and
                        most complete standing Roman structure in England. It is also claimed to be Britain's oldest
                        standing building. Built in the early 2nd century, the 5-level 8-sided tower was made of layers
                        of tufa, Kentish ragstone, and red bricks. The castle lighthouse survived after being converted
                        into a belfry in the Saxon era (c.1000), having a new upper layer added (c.1430), and was
                        partially renovated in 1913–1915. The remains of the other are located on the opposing Western
                        Heights, across the town of Dover. After the Battle of Hastings in October 1066, William the
                        Conqueror and his forces marched to Westminster Abbey for his coronation. They took a roundabout
                        route via Romney, Dover and Canterbury. From the Cinque Ports foundation in 1050, Dover has
                        always been a chief member—it may also have been this that first attracted William's attention,
                        and got Kent the motto of Invicta. In the words of William of Poitiers:
                        Then he marched to Dover, which had been reported impregnable and held by a large force. The
                        English, stricken with fear at his approach had confidence neither in their ramparts nor in the
                        numbers of their troops ... While the inhabitants were preparing to surrender unconditionally,
                        (the Normans), greedy for money, set the castle on fire and the great part of it was soon
                        enveloped in flames...[William then paid for the repair and] having taken possession of the
                        castle, the Duke spent eight days adding new fortifications to it'. The Castle was first built,
                        entirely out of clay. It collapsed to the ground and the clay was then used as the flooring for
                        many of the ground-floor rooms.
                        In 1088, eight knights were appointed under tenures to guard Dover Castle, their names were:
                        William d'Albrincis; Fulberl de Dover, William d'Arsic; Geoffrey Peverell; William Maminot;
                        Robert du Port; Hugh Crevecoeur; and Adam Fitzwilliam. It was during the reign of Henry II that
                        the castle began to take recognisable shape. The inner and outer baileys and the great keep
                        belong to this time. Maurice the Engineer was responsible for building the keep. From 1179 to
                        1188, the King spent over £6,500 on the castle, an enormous sum, considering that his annual
                        revenue was likely around £10,000.
                        In 1216, during the First Barons' War, a group of rebel barons invited the future Louis VIII of
                        France to come and take the English crown. He had some success breaching the walls, but was
                        ultimately unable to take the castle. The vulnerable north gate that had been breached in the
                        siege was converted into an underground forward-defence complex (including St John's Tower), and
                        new gates built into the outer curtain wall on the western (Fitzwilliam's Gate) and eastern
                        (Constable's Gate) sides. During the siege, the English defenders tunnelled outwards and
                        attacked the French.
                        During the time of Stephen de Pencester, a windmill was erected on Tower 22, which was later
                        known as the Mill Tower. By the Tudor age, the defences themselves had been superseded by
                        gunpowder. They were improved by Henry VIII, who made a personal visit, and added to it with the
                        Moat Bulwark. During the English Civil War it was held for the king but then taken by supporters
                        of the Parliamentarians in 1642 without a shot being fired. Knowing the castle was lightly
                        guarded, a local merchant Richard Dawkes accompanied by 10 men scaled the cliffs and attacked
                        the porter's lodge, obtaining the keys and entering the castle before the garrison was summoned.
                        Dover Castle was a crucial observation point for the cross-channel sightings of the Anglo-French
                        Survey, which used trigonometric calculations to link the Royal Greenwich Observatory with the
                        Paris Observatory. This work was overseen by General William Roy. </p>

                    <p>Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York, chief minister to and favourite of Henry VIII, took over the
                        site of Hampton Court Palace in 1514. It had previously been a property of the Order of St John
                        of Jerusalem. Over the following seven years, Wolsey spent lavishly (200,000 Crowns) to build
                        the finest palace in England at Hampton Court. Today, little of Wolsey's building work remains
                        unchanged. The first courtyard, the Base Court, (B on plan), was his creation, as was the
                        second, inner gatehouse which leads to the Clock Court (Wolsey's seal remains visible over the
                        entrance arch of the clock tower) which contained his private rooms. The Base Court contained
                        forty-four lodgings reserved for guests, while the second court (today, Clock Court) contained
                        the very best rooms – the state apartments – reserved for the King and his family. Henry VIII
                        stayed in the state apartments as Wolsey's guest immediately after their completion in 1525. In
                        building his palace, Wolsey was attempting to create a Renaissance cardinal's palace of a
                        rectilinear symmetrical plan with grand apartments on a raised piano nobile, all rendered with
                        classical detailing. The historian Jonathan Foyle has suggested that it is likely that Wolsey
                        had been inspired by Paolo Cortese's De Cardinalatu, a manual for cardinals that included advice
                        on palatial architecture, published in 1510. The architectural historian Sir John Summerson
                        asserts that the palace shows "the essence of Wolsey—the plain English churchman who
                        nevertheless made his sovereign the arbiter of Europe and who built and furnished Hampton Court
                        to show foreign embassies that Henry VIII's chief minister knew how to live as graciously as any
                        cardinal in Rome." Whatever the concepts were, the architecture is an excellent and rare example
                        of a thirty-year era when English architecture was in a harmonious transition from domestic
                        Tudor, strongly influenced by perpendicular Gothic, to the Italian Renaissance classical style.
                        Perpendicular Gothic owed nothing historically to the Renaissance style, yet harmonised well
                        with it. This blending of styles was realised by a small group of Italian craftsmen working at
                        the English court in the second and third decades of the sixteenth century. They specialised in
                        the adding of Renaissance ornament to otherwise straightforward Tudor buildings. It was one of
                        these, Giovanni da Maiano, who was responsible for the set of eight relief busts of Roman
                        emperors which were set in the Tudor brickwork. Anne Boleyn's Gate. The Tudor gatehouse and
                        astronomical clock, made for Henry VIII in 1540 (C on plan above) Two of the Renaissance bas
                        reliefs by Giovanni da Maiano can be seen set into the brickwork. Wolsey was only to enjoy his
                        palace for a few years. In 1528, knowing that his enemies and the King were engineering his
                        downfall, he passed the palace to the King as a gift. Wolsey died two years later in 1530.</p>

                    <p>Warwick Castle is a medieval castle developed from a wooden fort, originally built by William the
                        Conqueror during 1068. Warwick is the county town of Warwickshire, England, situated on a bend
                        of the River Avon. The original wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone during the
                        12th century. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified,
                        resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th-century military architecture. It was
                        used as a stronghold until the early 17th century, when it was granted to Sir Fulke Greville by
                        James I in 1604. Greville converted it to a country house and it was owned by the Greville
                        family, who became Earls of Warwick in 1759, until 1978 when it was bought by the Tussauds
                        Group.
                        In 2007, the Tussauds Group was purchased by The Blackstone Group which merged it with Merlin
                        Entertainments; Warwick Castle was then sold to Nick Leslau's investment firm Prestbury Group
                        under a sale and leaseback agreement. Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable
                        35-year lease.</p>

                    <p>Kenilworth Castle is located in the town of Kenilworth in Warwickshire, England. Constructed from
                        Norman through to Tudor times, the castle has been described by the architectural historian
                        Anthony Emery as "the finest surviving example of a semi-royal palace of the later middle ages,
                        significant for its scale, form and quality of workmanship"Kenilworth has also played an
                        important historical role. The castle was the subject of the six-month-long Siege of Kenilworth
                        in 1266, thought to be the longest siege in Medieval English history, and formed a base for
                        Lancastrian operations in the Wars of the Roses. Kenilworth was also the scene of the removal of
                        Edward II from the English throne, the French insult to Henry V in 1414 (said by John Strecche
                        to have encouraged the Agincourt campaign), and the Earl of Leicester's lavish reception of
                        Elizabeth I in 1575. The castle was built over several centuries. Founded in the 1120s around a
                        powerful Norman great tower, the castle was significantly enlarged by King John at the beginning
                        of the 13th century. Huge water defences were created by damming the local streams, and the
                        resulting fortifications proved able to withstand assaults by land and water in 1266. John of
                        Gaunt spent lavishly in the late 14th century, turning the medieval castle into a palace
                        fortress designed in the latest perpendicular style. The Earl of Leicester then expanded the
                        castle during his tenure in the 16th century, constructing new Tudor buildings and exploiting
                        the medieval heritage of Kenilworth to produce a fashionable Renaissance palace.</p>
